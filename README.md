# Dubins-Car-Example
Control Barrier Function (CBF) and Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) based control methods implemented on the simple kinematic car model (also known as [Dubins car](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubins_path)) to move an agent from a start point to a goal point is presented. Two scenarios are considered: i) an obstacle blocks a path to the goal point so safety and stability constraints are imposed and ii) no obstacle blocks a path to the goal point so only staiblity constraints are imposed. Furthermore, it is assumed the controller's maximum and minimum input saturates at a certain value.
